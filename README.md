# Tuzzie-sWebsite
Its a website for me by me. 

Goal:
I want to make a simple but elgent website that will be used to display personal projects both artistic and techinical in and orginized manner. I would also like a a blog section, i think, idk ill figure that out later. 

It would also be cool if it was hosted on my raz pi as well and the user had the option to switch between firebase and me. IDK we'll figure it out. 

- Home page
  - Name
  - Simple nav bar (links to: projects, music player, blog)
  - contact info ( email and socials ) 
  - photo of me, myself and i
  - Most recent Project
  - funfact/rambling

- Music Streaming Page
  - Albums in grid
  - Sort function ( newest, oldest, most popular, least popular, my ranking )
  - Search bar
  - Playback bar
    * Start Stop
    * Skip forward & backward
    * Name & authors(if its not just me)
